<br>
## Modules Implemented
Common Subexpression elimination
Strength Reduction
Constant Propagation 
Constant Folding

## Steps to execute
Execute the runner.py file
Enter the file name to be optimized in the console
The final optimized file is available in optimizer.py. The intermediate files optim1.py, optim2.py and optim3.py are generated after common subexpression elimination, strength reduction, constant propagation and constant folding.
(A sample test file is available in test.py and test2.py)
